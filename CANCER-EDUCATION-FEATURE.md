### **2. Myths vs Facts** ❌✅
5 Common Myths Debunked:

#### **MYTH: Cancer is Always a Death Sentence**
✅ **FACT:** Many cancers are highly treatable! Survival rates for many cancers now exceed 90% with modern treatments when caught early.

#### **MYTH: Cancer is Contagious**
✅ **FACT:** Cancer itself cannot spread person-to-person. However, some viruses (like HPV) that can lead to cancer are transmissible - but vaccines exist!

#### **MYTH: Sugar Feeds Cancer**
✅ **FACT:** While cancer cells use glucose like all cells, eating sugar doesn't make cancer grow faster. A balanced diet is what matters.

✅ **FACT:** While cancer risk increases with age, it can affect anyone at any age, including children. Early detection is important for everyone.

#### **MYTH: Cell Phones Cause Cancer**
